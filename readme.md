# 100-Days-of-LeetCode
## Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms

### Introduction

> According to SG Analytics (2020), 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were created every day. Also, billions of bytes are generated across social medias, online stores, etc. Moreover, this figure will only increase through time. Imagining, processing and analyzing this much data using traditional programming tools and structures would be practically impossible.
> 
### Objective

> Drawing valid conclusions from large data would require more than simple descriptive statistics. More complex algorithms are used to analyze big data in microseconds and come up with a real-time solution. Furthermore, understanding the design of algorithms helps one in writing good optimized code. My objective is to learn fundamental data structures and algorithms. I have also decided to practice what I have learnt, and will be learning. What better place would it be if not on one of the best platforms to learn DSA, LeetCode!

### Why am I really doing this?

> Along my journey in data analytics and hoping to transition to data science and machine learning, I realized sound understanding of algorithms and data structures is crucial. One of the best ways to improve and practice is by solving coding questions. Therefore, I have decided to solve at **least** 1 question on LeetCode per day. However, this is not the peak of my learning. I usually contest on LeetCode and Codeforces, and also read books like CLRS to further aid my learning. My preferred languages are Python and C++.

### What do I hope to learn in the long run?

> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". Before learning more sophisticated algorithms, I wish to learn some basic data structures and algorithms. This will help in writing more optimized code. Common DSA which include queues and stacks, dynamic programming, memoization, recursion, binary search, linked list, trees, knapsack problems etc.

### What I do when I am not learning algorithms  

> "I pursue my Data Science and Machine Learning Career. According to advice from experts in the industry, it is better to start off with Data Analytics. Then, one can build up on previously gained knowledge and experience. More or less the reason I started with data analytics, to have a solid foundation!

### A little bit about Data Analysis

> Although this is a little bit off topic, yet, I feel like sharing what I have learnt or rather learning and the courses I am taking. I am currently enrolled in the Alx Data Analytics Program and OneCampus Data Analytics track. In the next few months, I would have more in-depth knowledge about the data analytics process: Data Extraction, Cleaning, Wrangling, Analysis and Action. I will also build a few projects which will available soon. Thank You!
