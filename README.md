# 100-Days-of-LeetCode
## Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

### Introduction
> According to SG Analytics (2020), 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were created every day. Also, billions of bytes are generated across social medias, online stores, etc. Morever, this figure will only increase through time. Imagining, processing and analysing this much data using traditional programming tools would be practically impossible.
> 
### Objective
> Drawing valid conclusions from large data would require more than simple descriptive statistics. Understanding and the design of algorithms helps one in writing good optimized code. Furthermore, sophisticated algorithms can be use to analysize big data in microseconds and come up with a real-time solution.
>
### Why am I really doing this?
> Along my journey from data analytics to data science and machine learning, I realise sound understanding of algorithms and data structures is crucial. One of the best ways to improve and practice is by solving coding questions. Therefore, I have decided to solve at least 1 question on Leetcode per day. However, this is not the peak of my learning. I usually contest on Leetcode and Codeforces, I have a certification in DSA issued by Jovian and I also read books like CLRS to further aid my learning. 
>
### What do I hope to learn in the long run?
> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step". Before learning more sophisticated algorithms, I wish to learn some basic data structures and algorithms. This will help write more optimized code. Common DSA I will learn include Queues and stacks, Dynamic programming, binary search, linked list, trees, knapsack problems etc. 
>
### What I do when I am not learning algorithms  
> "I pursue my Data Science and Machine Learning Career. According to advise from experts in the industry, it is better to start off with Data Analytics. Then, one can build up on previously gained knowledge and experience.
>
### A little bit about Data Analysis
> Although this question is a little bit off topic, yet, I feel like sharing what I have learnt or rather learning and the courses I am taking. I am currently enrolled in the Alx Data Analytics Program and OneCampus Data Analytics track. In the next few months, I would have more indepth knowledge about the data analytics process: Data Extraction, Cleaning, Wrangling, Analysis and Action. I will also build a few projects which will available soon. Thank You!
