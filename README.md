# 100-Days-of-LeetCode
## Algorithms and Data Structures Practice

### Introduction
> According to SG Analytics (2020), 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were created every day. Also, billions of bytes are generated across social medias, online stores, etc. Morever, this figure will only increase through time. Imagining, processing and analysing this much data using traditional programming tools would be practically impossible.
> 
### Objective
> Drawing valid conclusions from large data would require more than simple descriptive statistics. Understanding and the design of algorithms helps one in writing good optimized code. Furthermore, sophisticated algorithms can be use to analysize big data in microseconds and come up with a real-time solution.
>
### Why am I really doing this?
> Along my journey from data analytics to data science and machine learning, I realise sound understanding of algorithms and data structures is crucial. Therefore, I have decided to solve at least 1 question on Leetcode. However, this is not the peak of my learning. I contest on Leetcode and Codeforces, I have a certification in DSA issued by Jovian and I also read books like CLRS to further aid my learning. 
>
### What I hope to learn in the long run?
> Queues and stacks, Dynamic programming, binary search, linked list, trees, knapsack problems etc. 

###  What else to expect
